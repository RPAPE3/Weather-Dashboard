Project Title: Weather Dashboard

Project Description: This interactive Weather Dashboard will display the current and 5 day forecast of the city that the user inputs. The display will show the temp, wind, humidity and an icon associated with that day. It will also save the previously viewed cities on the screen. The user can go back and click on the previously viewed city to pull up the weather information again.
